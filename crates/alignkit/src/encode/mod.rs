//! CoreML wrapper over `base960h_aligner.mlmodelc` (design spec §3
//! Candidate A): the fixed-window wav2vec2 CTC acoustic encoder,
//! `waveform [1, 960_000]` f32 in, `emissions [1, 2999, 29]` f32 out,
//! 20 ms/frame (stride 320 samples @ 16 kHz) — ground truth pinned by
//! `tests/model_io.rs::base960h_aligner_io_matches_spec`.
//!
//! # Fixed-window bridging
//!
//! [`Encoder::emissions`] hides the model's fixed 60 s window behind a
//! variable-length `&[f32]` contract, mirroring asry's own encoder call
//! shape (`(1, T) -> (1, T', V)`, `asry/src/runner/aligner/algorithm/
//! encode.rs`) as closely as a fixed-window CoreML graph allows:
//!
//! - **Longer than [`ENCODER_WINDOW_SAMPLES`]**: rejected with
//!   [`AlignError::InputTooLong`] rather than silently truncated. The
//!   caller (a future `Aligner`, spec §6/§7) is responsible for chunking
//!   audio to at most [`ENCODER_WINDOW_SAMPLES`] before calling — see
//!   "60 s clamp vs asry's `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`" below for why this crate's
//!   ceiling is far tighter than asry's own per-chunk cap.
//! - **Shorter**: zero-padded up to exactly [`ENCODER_WINDOW_SAMPLES`],
//!   never rejected — unlike `dia-coreml`'s `SegmentModel::infer`, which
//!   rejects rather than pads short input
//!   (`crates/dia-coreml/src/segment/mod.rs`'s "dia contract match"
//!   section). wav2vec2 is not causal, so whether padding perturbs
//!   in-range emissions remains an open empirical question, not an
//!   assumption — it is for the B5 word-timing parity gate to measure, per
//!   design spec §3's Candidate A note.
//! - **`emissions` frames past the real (non-padded) audio**: truncated
//!   away — see [`Encoder::emissions`]'s doc for the exact formula and why
//!   it must be clamped to the model's actual frame count.
//!
//! # 60 s clamp vs asry's `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`
//!
//! asry's own chunk-size ceiling is `pub const MAX_CHUNK_SIZE: Duration =
//! Duration::from_secs(600);` (`asry/src/core/transcriber.rs:137`) — 10
//! minutes. [`ENCODER_WINDOW_SAMPLES`] is 60 s, ten times tighter. This is
//! a deliberate, DOCUMENTED divergence, not a parity target: asry's 600 s
//! cap bounds per-chunk RAM for its own (non-fixed-window) ONNX wav2vec2
//! path, which allocates proportionally to whatever length it is given.
//! `base960h_aligner.mlmodelc` allocates a *fixed* 960,000-sample
//! input / `[1, 2999, 29]` output tensor pair regardless of how much of it
//! is real audio, so there is no equivalent "let it grow" option on this
//! side — the model's own fixed graph is the ceiling, not a tunable. A
//! caller (the future `Aligner`, spec §6/§7) must chunk audio to at most
//! [`ENCODER_WINDOW_SAMPLES`] before calling [`Encoder::emissions`]; that
//! chunking responsibility is explicitly out of scope here (design spec
//! §7's data flow already assumes per-chunk audio, not a whole-file
//! stream).
//!
//! # The log-prob door: `from_log_probs`, not `from_logits`
//!
//! [`Encoder::emissions`] wraps the raw `emissions` tensor into an
//! [`Emissions`] through [`Emissions::from_log_probs`] — the log-prob door —
//! with **no softmax or log-softmax applied**. The model's own graph already
//! ends in one (`Models/alignkit/base960h_aligner.mlmodelc/model.mil`, final
//! ops — this is graph truth, not an inference from measured values):
//!
//! ```text
//! linear_73_cast_fp16       = linear(...)                          // CTC head → logits
//! var_849_softmax_cast_fp16 = softmax(axis = -1, x = linear_73_cast_fp16)
//! var_849_cast_fp16         = log(epsilon = 0x1p-149, x = var_849_softmax_cast_fp16)
//! emissions                 = cast(dtype = fp32, x = var_849_cast_fp16)
//! ```
//!
//! The reason to prefer this door is NOT that re-applying a log-softmax
//! would corrupt the values. It would not: **log-softmax is exactly
//! idempotent.** For `y = log_softmax(x)`, `lse(y) = ln Σ exp(x_j − lse(x)) =
//! ln 1 = 0`, so `log_softmax(y) = y`. Routing genuine log-probs through
//! [`Emissions::from_logits`] (asry's raw-logit door, which applies
//! `log_softmax_with_finite_guard`) would be a numerical no-op.
//!
//! The real reason is that `from_log_probs` doubles as a **contract check on
//! the model artifact**. Its `O(T·V)` value-domain scan (every element finite
//! ∧ `<= 0`) is an assertion that the tensor really is log-probs. Should a
//! future model revision ship a raw-logit CTC head — entirely plausible,
//! since that is the *standard* wav2vec2 export, and asry's own ONNX model
//! does exactly that (`asry/src/runner/aligner/algorithm/encode.rs` takes the
//! `from_logits` door) — the scan sees positive maxima and fails **loudly**
//! with [`AlignError::Alignment`] (`EmissionsError::Value`). `from_logits`
//! would instead **silently re-normalize** the garbage into a plausible
//! log-prob domain and align on it forever. That is precisely the bug class
//! this seam exists to kill: the scan is the guard, so the door that runs it
//! is the door to take.
//!
//! For the same reason the raw tensor is passed through **unclamped**. The
//! graph's `softmax` output is in `[0, 1]` by construction, so its `log` is
//! `<= 0` *guaranteed by the graph* (measured max is exactly `0.0` on every
//! compute placement). An unbounded `.min(0.0)` would be actively dangerous —
//! it is exactly what would mask a raw-logit model from the scan above. If a
//! clamp is ever needed here, it must be **bounded** to a pinned slack, never
//! open-ended.
//!
//! # The floor: [`LOG_PROB_FLOOR`], the door's other half
//!
//! [`Emissions::from_log_probs`]'s scan bounds the emissions from **above**
//! (`<= 0`) and rules out non-finite values. It does not bound them from
//! **below**, and it cannot: `-45440` is finite and negative, so an
//! ANE-corrupted matrix — every softmax output under the fp16 floor underflowed
//! to `0`, every `log(0)` saturated to that sentinel
//! ([`DEFAULT_ENCODER_COMPUTE`]) — sails straight through it and aligns to
//! plausible, silently wrong timings.
//!
//! That gap was reachable from this crate's own public API
//! ([`EncoderOptions::with_compute`], [`crate::AlignerOptions::with_compute`]),
//! and it was the *measured* defect, not the hypothetical one the paragraph
//! above guards against. So [`Encoder::emissions`] scans the other side too:
//! any cell below [`LOG_PROB_FLOOR`] is [`AlignError::CorruptEmissions`], a
//! typed error that NAMES the compute placement the encoder was loaded with.
//! Loud, and self-diagnosing.

  /// That door's scan bounds the emissions from above and rules out non-finite

  /// plausible alignment 881 ms off. Unlike [`Self::emissions_raw`], which
  /// hands back the tensor unchecked, **this is the guarded door** — and the
  /// only one [`crate::aligner::Aligner`] uses.
  ///
  /// `encoder_input` is the buffer the model runs on. For the alignment
  /// pipeline it is `PreparedChunk::encoder_input()` — asry has already
  /// applied the silence mask and padded to wav2vec2's receptive field — so
  /// this method never re-implements the mask; a standalone caller may pass
  /// raw samples directly. Shorter than [`ENCODER_WINDOW_SAMPLES`], it is
  /// zero-padded up to the full window before prediction.
  ///
  /// `real_samples` is the count of REAL (pre-mask, pre-pad) audio samples
  /// the chunk represents — for the pipeline, the `samples.len()` handed to
  /// `prepare`. asry keeps `PreparedChunk::real_samples` crate-private, so
  /// the consumer supplies it; it feeds the truncation formula alone and is
  /// never re-scanned. Frames computed from the padded tail are truncated
  /// away, so the result reflects only the real audio.
  ///
  /// # Truncation formula
  ///
  /// Nominal: `ceil(real_samples / HOP_SAMPLES)` (design spec §3:
  /// `T_frames = ceil(real_samples / 320)`) — each [`HOP_SAMPLES`]-sample
  /// stride of real audio should contribute (at least) one real frame.
  /// Clamped to [`Self::frames`]: wav2vec2's convolutional feature
  /// extractor is not an exact `real_samples / HOP_SAMPLES` divider (its
  /// multi-layer kernel/stride chain has kernels slightly wider than their
  /// strides, so a handful of samples at the very end of a full window
  /// contribute no additional frame). Concretely, for `real_samples ==
  /// ENCODER_WINDOW_SAMPLES` (960,000 — no padding at all, exactly the
  /// `ted_60.wav` fixture's own case), the nominal formula evaluates to
  /// 3,000 (`960_000 / 320`), one more than
  /// `base960h_aligner.mlmodelc`'s actual 2,999
  /// (`tests/model_io.rs::base960h_aligner_io_matches_spec`). Without the
  /// clamp, this method would try to keep a 3,000th frame that was never
  /// written into its `copy_into`-filled buffer for any `real_samples` in
  /// `(Self::frames() * HOP_SAMPLES, ENCODER_WINDOW_SAMPLES]` — see
  /// `tests.rs` for a regression pinning exactly this boundary.
  ///
  /// [`HOP_SAMPLES`] is the ONE stride in this crate: the same constant times
  /// the words in [`crate::aligner::Aligner`]'s seam. It is fixed by the
  /// model's graph and is deliberately not configurable — a caller-settable
