//! Text utilities: zlib compression-ratio repetition signal, string
//! normalization, and the streaming word-timing prefix/suffix helpers.
//! Ports `Utilities/TextUtilities.swift`
//! `TextUtilities.compressionRatio(of:)` (both overloads),
//! `Utilities/Extensions+Public.swift` `String.normalized`/
//! `String.trimmingSpecialTokenCharacters()`, and two functions from
//! `Utilities/TranscriptionUtilities.swift`: `findLongestCommonPrefix`/

//!
//! `Array.batched` (`Core/WhisperKit.swift:739`, concurrent-worker audio
//! batching) is unrelated to the above and stays out of scope: Plan 3 uses
//! `slice::chunks` directly wherever batching is needed, and this sync,
