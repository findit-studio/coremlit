//! Structured transcription provenance (coremlit issue #14, following
//! issue #9's "record what produced this transcript" recommendation):
//! [`Provenance`] bundles, in one serde-serializable record, the decode
//! facts that determine — or merely describe — a transcript, so a consumer
//! can persist them alongside the text instead of hand-assembling the
//! bundle from [`DecodingOptions`]/[`ComputeOptions`]/
//! [`TranscriptionSegment`] at every call site.
//!
//! # What this type can and cannot know
//!
//! This module is deliberately honest about the boundary, because a
//! provenance record that quietly invents a field is worse than one that
//! admits the gap:
//!
//! - **Library-known** — the **whole resolved [`DecodingOptions`]**, embedded
//!   verbatim ([`Provenance::decoding`]); the [`ComputeOptions`] the pipeline
//!   was built with; and — from the transcript itself — the language the
//!   decode actually **detected** and the *effective* temperature it actually
//!   landed on. [`Provenance::from_options`] fills in everything the options
//!   alone settle; [`Provenance::for_result`] adds the two outcome facts, and
//!   is the constructor to reach for when you have a transcript in hand.
//!
//!   Note *whole*, and note **embedded** rather than projected. An earlier
//!   shape hand-copied a curated subset of [`DecodingOptions`]' knobs into
//!   flat fields here, and it did what every hand-maintained projection does:
//!   it drifted. It reached 30 options captured as 11, and the 19 it silently
//!   dropped included
//!   [`DecodingOptions::drop_blank_audio`] and [`DecodingOptions::word_grouping`]
//!   — two knobs that visibly change the transcript, so two runs that differed
//!   only in them left **byte-identical records**. Embedding the struct makes
//!   completeness true *by construction*: a knob added to [`DecodingOptions`]
//!   tomorrow is captured here with no edit to this file, and cannot be
//!   forgotten. `provenance::tests`' mutation table enforces it — its coverage
//!   check is derived from [`DecodingOptions`]' own serialized key set, so a
//!   new field fails the suite until it is exercised.
//! - **Consumer-supplied** — three facts this crate cannot observe. All
//!   start `None`, stay `None` until the caller sets them, and are never
//!   guessed:
//!   - The model identity ([`Provenance::model_id`]/
//!     [`Provenance::model_revision`]) and the tokenizer identity
//!     ([`Provenance::tokenizer_id`]/[`Provenance::tokenizer_revision`]).
//!     These are *load-time* facts: this crate loads models and tokenizers
//!     from plain local folders ([`crate::options::Options`] holds nothing
//!     but two [`std::path::Path`]s; model auto-download is deferred, spec
//!     §4.7), so nothing in the pipeline ever sees a Hub repo id or a git
//!     revision. Only the caller — who *does* know which artifact it put
//!     in those folders — can say. This crate will not fabricate a
//!     revision it cannot observe.
//!   - The VAD detector ([`Provenance::vad_detector`]). It is
//!     **doubly** unobservable: the pipeline holds it as a
//!     `Box<dyn VoiceActivityDetector>`
//!     ([`crate::transcribe::WhisperKit::vad_detector`]), and a trait
//!     object carries no identity to read; and it lives on
//!     [`WhisperKit`](crate::transcribe::WhisperKit), not in
//!     [`DecodingOptions`] or [`ComputeOptions`], so the constructors here
//!     could not reach it even if it had a name. That is why the record's
//!     [`DecodingOptions::chunking_strategy`] says only *whether* VAD ran.
//!     Supplying the detector matters because swapping it
//!     ([`crate::transcribe::WhisperKit::set_vad_detector`]) moves the
//!     chunk boundaries, and the boundaries move the transcript — so two
//!     runs differing *only* in detector would otherwise leave
//!     byte-identical records with no trace of what made their text
//!     differ.
//!
//! # Why these fields are worth recording
//!
//! - **The compute unit changes the output.** CoreML's CPU, GPU, and
//!   Neural Engine paths do not produce bit-identical floating-point
//!   results, so a transcript is only reproducible against the same
//!   [`ComputeOptions`] — this crate's own golden baselines are pinned
//!   per-unit for exactly that reason. Recording the units is what makes a
//!   later mismatch diagnosable instead of mysterious.
//! - **A non-zero temperature is not reproducible without a seed.** The
//!   temperature-fallback ladder samples stochastically once it climbs off
//!   `0.0`, and [`DecodingOptions::seed`] is unset by default (OS-seeded,
//!   matching Swift's own unseeded draw). [`Provenance::effective_temperature`]
//!   is therefore the field that tells you whether the decode was
//!   greedy/deterministic (`Some(0.0)`) or sampled, and
//!   [`DecodingOptions::seed`] — embedded with the rest of the options —
//!   tells you whether that sampling can be replayed at all. Record both, or
//!   a re-run that disagrees is uninvestigable.
//! - **Auto-detect makes the *configured* language useless as a record.**
//!   It is `""` whenever the decoder is left to detect (the default
//!   pairing), so a record built from options alone names no language at
//!   all. [`Provenance::detected_language`] is the field that carries what
//!   was actually spoken, and only [`Provenance::for_result`] — which is
//!   handed the transcript — can fill it in.
